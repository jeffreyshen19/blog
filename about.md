    Hi, I'm Jeffrey! I'm interested in exploring complex political and social topics through computer science.
  </p>
  <p>Politics and culture are issues rarely associated with computer science, yet technology can help visualize the most complex of issues with some degree of objectivity. The intent of this blog is to facilitate this intersectionâ€”to use data and CS to bring accessibility and attention to the important issues of our time.</p>
  <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
  <p>I'm a current senior at Phillips Academy in Massachusetts, though I'm originally from Los Angeles (ðŸŒ´). Beyond CS & politics, I like to read, run, and listen to podcasts. I'm a strong supporter of open source software, digital governance, and a free press. You can learn more about me and the type of work I do at <a href = "http://jeffreyshen.com">my website</a> or check out <a href = "https://github.com/jeffreyshen19">my Github</a>.</p>

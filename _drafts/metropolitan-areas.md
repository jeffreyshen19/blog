      Here are the city boundaries, containing around four million people.
    </section>
    <section class="step">
      You'll notice these boundaries don't actually include many places we think are part of L.A.
    </section>
    <section class="step">
      In fact, Los Angeles proper doesn't even include "East Los Angeles", which is a separate, unincorporated municipality.
    </section>
    <section class="step">
      If we instead look at the "L.A.-Long Beach-Anaheim Urbanized Area" (as determined by the Census), the boundaries fit more of what we expect L.A. to look like.

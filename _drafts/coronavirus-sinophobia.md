As the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak continues to accelerate, criticism of how the Chinese government is handling the crisis is also beginning to mount. While many of these critiques are valid—Beijing did not begin mobilizing a response until [thousands had already been infected](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/world/asia/china-coronavirus-xi-jinping.html), and markets like the one in Wuhan where the outbreak is believed to have originated have [nearly no regulations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/asia/china-markets-coronavirus-sars.html)—much of the response to coronavirus has taken on a distinctly Sinophobic edge.

From [comments](https://twitter.com/SimuLiu/status/1222459446799921153) telling ethnically Chinese people who live in the West to “stay in China till the flu is gone” to posts insinuating that all Chinese people eat bats, snakes, and dogs, many of the social media responses to coronavirus generalize all Chinese people as diseased and disgusting.

Chinese communities around the world have also been the target of racist backlashes, with Chinese restaurants losing business and being bombarded with [racist comments](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/28/canada-chinese-community-battles-racist-backlash-amid-coronavirus-outbreak) online and [reports of racial profiling against Asians](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/coronavirus-china-live-updates/2020/01/29/d49b9194-423b-11ea-b503-2b077c436617_story.html).
